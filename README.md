# Hi, my name is Ievgen!

I am a motivated web developer with solid knowledge in frontend and backend development. I have experience working with technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, TypeScript, Node.js, Redux, MySQL, and MongoDB. I continuously improve my skills by learning new tools and development practices to create modern, functional, and user-friendly web applications.

I am eager to join a team of professionals to grow in the IT field and contribute to the creation of high-quality digital products. My approach includes a responsible attitude towards tasks, attention to detail, and a commitment to high standards in my work.

In addition to technical skills, I have strong communication abilities that help me work effectively in a team. I am fluent in Ukrainian and Russian, have an A2 level in English, and a beginner level in Spanish, which allows me to communicate in an international environment.

I am ready for new challenges, continuous learning, and active participation in the development of your project! üåü
